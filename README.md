To get started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository or download zip and install the dependencies:

###Prerequisites

* You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from http://nodejs.org/.


###Clone Angular-ShoppingCart-project 

```
git clone https://github.com/sanjeev-chauhan/Angular-ShoppingCart-Project.git
cd Angular-ShoppingCart-Project
```

### Install Dependencies
* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```
